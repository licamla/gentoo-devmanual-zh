msgid "Terminology: ABI stands for \"Application Binary Interface\". It refers to issues like calling conventions (which registers are used for passing parameters when calling functions) and the size of data types. ISA stands for \"Instruction Set Architecture\", and refers to the instructions available and the number and types of registers for a given CPU."

msgid "The <placeholder-1/> ABI was a wonderful invention by SGI that was good at the time, but later turned out to be a little bit short-sighted and inefficient. The <placeholder-2/> ABI corrects that problem by pretending to be 32 bit, whilst in reality being 64 bit. <placeholder-3/> is another 64 bit ABI, this time not pretending to be 32 bit, which is therefore large, fat and yet very powerful."
