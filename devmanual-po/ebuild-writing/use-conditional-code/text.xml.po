msgid "Often a particular block of code must only be executed if a given USE flag is set (or unset). For large blocks, <placeholder-1/> is best, or for inverse tests either <placeholder-2/> or <placeholder-3/> can be used (the former is more common and is recommended for readability). For single-statement conditions, the <placeholder-4/> (or <placeholder-5/> for negatives) form is often more readable."
