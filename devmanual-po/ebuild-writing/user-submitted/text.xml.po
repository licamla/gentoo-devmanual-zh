When not working from a diff but from a complete user-submitted ebuild, the <placeholder-1/> command should be used to see what has changed; attention should be payed for anything from the current ebuild that should appear in the new ebuild, or anything in the new ebuild that should be fixed or removed."

Be sure to be thankful for any submission, even if it isn't very good. Be polite but honest <d/> if an ebuild isn't usable, the user can be told in a way that does not insult their current ebuild-writing abilities. Remember that the user who submitted that broken ebuild may be a skilled and productive member of our project in the future <d/> that is, if they receive the right amount of encouragement and support and continue to improve in their abilities."
