<p>
The management structure of Gentoo, called the "metastructure", is
defined in
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GLEP:39#Specification">
GLEP 39</uri>. In Gentoo, a project is a group of developers working
towards a common goal in various different areas. For example, the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Devmanual">
Devmanual</uri> project focuses on maintaining this document. Many
others are responsible for maintaining packages. Projects spanning a
large area of topics can have multiple subprojects specializing in
particular fields within the domain of the parent project and thus
form a project hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
A package maintained by a project needs to have the
project explicitly listed as a maintainer in its
<uri link="::ebuild-writing/misc-files/metadata">metadata.xml</uri>.
The full listing of all the projects can be found on
<uri link="https://api.gentoo.org/metastructure/projects.xml">
api.gentoo.org</uri> or on the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Gentoo">wiki</uri>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Starting New Projects</title>
<body>

<p>
According to the metastructure any developer may create a new
project. There are two procedures involved in starting a new project:

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a new project page <uri
    link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Developer_Central/Project_pages">
    through the wiki</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Post a Request For Comments (RFC) email to the gentoo-dev
    mailing list.
  </li>
</ol>

There is no approval required for the RFC and negative comments do not
block a developer from creating a project. Competing projects are
allowed to co-exist in Gentoo; existence of another project with
similar goals do not block another developer from starting a new
project with the same goals.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Joining and Leaving a Project</title>
<body>

<p>
Members of a project are managed through the project's page on the
Gentoo Wiki. Each page has a "Project" template in its source which
lists the members of the project. Simply modifying the list is
sufficient for adding or removing a developer. Note that different
projects have different requirements and procedures for recruiting
developers, which may require prior arrangements to be made before
modifying the member list.
</p>

<p>
Developers should remember to add themselves to the alias by editing
<c><path>/var/mail/alias/misc/&lt;alias name&gt;</path></c> on
dev.gentoo.org. For example, the alias for the Devmanual project is
located at <c>/var/mail/alias/misc/devmanual</c>, which corresponds to
the project's email address <c>devmanual@gentoo.org</c>.

<title>Herds</title>
<body>

<warning>
Herds have been declared obsolete as per the Gentoo Council's <uri
link="https://projects.gentoo.org/council/meeting-logs/20160110-summary.txt">
decision on January 10, 2016</uri>. The following section is preserved
for historical purposes.
</warning>

<p>
A <e>herd</e> is a collection of packages with an associated set of maintainers.
It can happen for example because of retirement that a herd has no developers
but this should be avoided if at all possible. A herd has an associated email
address which can be used for bugzilla assignments. This email address is
<b>not</b> always <c>herdname@gentoo.org</c> <d/> for example, because of the
way Gentoo's email aliases are set up, the <c>cron</c> herd use
<c>cron-bugs@gentoo.org</c> (aliases cannot match system usernames).
</p>

<p>
A <e>project</e> is a group formed for handling a particular general area. A project
may have herds associated with it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes herd and project names overlap <d/> for example, the <c>sparc</c> project
has an associated <c>sparc</c> herd which maintains sparc-specific packages (such
as the <c>silo</c> bootloader). This is <e>not</e> always the case.
